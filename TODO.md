# Todo

1. Implement more nuanced error messages. These should be based upon
   existing defaults, presence of targets, etc.
2. Allow *"unpathifying"* executables. Defaults to saved destination
   directory, overridden in the usual way.
4. Create a better help section.
5. Make templates for the different shell scripting languages (bash, ...)
   so that it can produce scripts that work in any shell.
