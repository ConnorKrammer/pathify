# Todo

1. Make templates for the different shell scripting languages (bash, ...)
   so that pathify can produce scripts that work in any shell. This should
   auto-detect the shell but be able to be overridden with a configuration
   option.
2. Implement the `undo` command.
3. Ensure consistency for entering wrong command (print help).
4. Prettify the output when using a command incorrectly (override the
   formatter).
5. Write code documentation.
