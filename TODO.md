# Todo

1. Implement more nuanced error messages. These should be based upon
   existing defaults, presence of targets, etc.
2. Allow *"unpathifying"* executables. Defaults to saved destination
   directory, overridden in the usual way.
3. Make templates for the different shell scripting languages (bash, ...)
   so that it can produce scripts that work in any shell.
