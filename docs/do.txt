do => Pathify a file.

Usage:
  pathify do [<target>] [--destination <path>] [-name <name>]
             [--interpreter <interpreter>] [--save <options>]

Options:
  --destination | -d
  Specifies the folder to put the pathified file in. Including a
  filename after the folder path is equivalent to passing that
  filename in with the `--name` option. This option is not required
  if a default destination has been set.
  NOTE: The --name substitution function is under review and is not
  yet implemented. For now, including a filename in the destination
  path will raise an error.

  --name | -n
  Specifies the name the pathified file is to have. Will be
  overridden by `--destination` if that option is passed with a
  filename included. Defaults to the name of the `<target>`.

  --interpreter | -i
  Specifies the interpreter to pass the pathified file to. This
  option can be used on Windows as a shebang substitute when
  pathifying scripts. It is of limited use on other systems.

  --save | -s
  Saves specified options used in the current call to pathify
  as defaults. If pathify is cancelled mid-run then for safety
  options will not be saved.

  <target>
  An absolute or relative path to the file to be pathified. If passed
  a directory, the user will be prompted to select a file from that path.
  If left blank, will default to the current working directory.

  <path>
  A path to the destination folder. May include a filename, in which
  case the `<name>` argument will be overridden.

  <name>
  The name to use for the pathified file.

  <interpreter>
  The path of an interpreter, or just the interpreter's command if it
  exists in the user's path already.

  <options>
  The type of information to save from the current run of pathify.
  'i' or 'interpreter' will save `<interpreter>` (if specified> as the
  default for the filetype of the `<target>`. 'd' or 'destination' will
  save `<destination>` as the default for any filetype. 'id' or 'di' are
  shorthand for both.
