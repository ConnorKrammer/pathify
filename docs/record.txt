record => Print or update the recordfile.

Usage:
  pathify record [--update] [--ls]

Options:
  --ls
  Print the list of pathified files, organized by location. By
  default `pathify record` prints the list of pathified files,
  but this option is required if `--update` is also passed. If
  `--update` is passed, which files were added or removed will
  also be shown.

  --update | -u
  Updates the recordfile by searching for added or removed files
  in the folders specified by GENERAL[defaultdestination] and
  GENERAL[searchfolders].
  Using this flag will suppress the printing of the recordfile
  unless the `--ls` flag is also passed.
