Pathify.py -- Create a file that links to a target executable.

Usage:
   pathify -h | --help
   pathify <target> [-d] [-n] [-i] [-s]
   pathify --setopt <option> <value>

Options:

   -h | --help
   Print this help text.

   <target>
   An absolute or relative path to the file to be pathified. Required.

   -d <destination> | --destination <destination>
   The destination folder to place the pathified file. Including a
   filename after the folder path is equivalent to passing that
   filename in with the --name option. This option is not required
   if a default destination has been set.

   -n <name> | --name <name>
   The filename that the pathified file should be given. Defaults to
   be the same as the target file, and does not include an extension.
   Will be overriden by --destination if that option is passed with
   a filename included. Optional.

   -i [<interpreter>] | --interpreter [<interpreter>]
   A path to an interpreter to run the pathified file through, or the
   name of an executable already in your path. If the flag is included
   but no argument, it will attempt to find a default in config.ini.
   Can be used on Windows as a shebang substitute. Of limited use on
   other systems.

   -s <option> | --save <option>
   Saves the specified options used as defaults. Passing 'i', or
   'interpreter' as an argument will save the current interpreter as the
   default for the pathified filetype; 'd', or 'destination' will save the
   current destination as default for any filetype. 'id' or 'di' will save
   both. If pathify is cancelled at any point then the options will not be
   saved.

   --setopt <option> <value>
   Sets the specified configuration option the the given value. Available
   options include:
    - destination: the default destination path
    - interpreter[<filetype>]: the default interpreter for the given filetype
   Pathify's preferences can be found in config.ini, and may be edited by
   hand.
