Pathify.py -- Create a file that links to a target executable.

Usage:
   pathify -h | --help
   pathify <target> [-d] [-n] [-i] [-s]
   pathify --setopt <option> <value>

Options:

   -h | --help
   Print this help text.

   <target>
   An absolute or relative path to the file to be pathified. Required.

   -d <destination> | --destination <destination>
   The destination folder to place the pathified file. Including a
   filename after the folder path is equivalent to passing that
   filename in with the `--name` option. This option is not required
   if a default destination has been set.

   -n <name> | --name <name>
   The filename that the pathified file should be given. Defaults to
   be the same as the target file, and does not include an extension.
   Will be overriden by `--destination` if that option is passed with
   a filename included. Optional.

   -i [<interpreter>] | --interpreter [<interpreter>]
   A path to an interpreter to run the pathified file through, or the
   name of an executable already in your path. If the flag is included
   sans argument then `config.ini` will be checked for a default value.
   If an argument is included, however, then it will override any existing
   defaults.
   This option can be used on Windows as a shebang substitute when
   pathifying scripts. It is of limited use on other systems.

   -s <option> | --save <option>
   Saves the specified options used as defaults. Passing 'i', or
   'interpreter' as an argument will save the current interpreter as the
   default for the pathified filetype; 'd', or 'destination' will save the
   current destination as default for any filetype. 'id' or 'di' will save
   both. If pathify is cancelled at any point then the options will not be
   saved.

   --setopt <option> <value>
   Sets the specified configuration option to the the given value. Options
   are passed in a `section[option]` format, or just `option` with the
   section assumed to be `GENERAL`. Currently the available options are:
    => general[destination]: the default destination path
    => interpreter[<filetype>]: the default interpreter for the given filetype
   Pathify's preferences can be found in `config.ini`, and may be edited by
   hand.
